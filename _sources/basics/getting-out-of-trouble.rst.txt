Getting Out of Trouble
======================

Before starting, it's helpful to know these keystrokes:

=================================  =======================
Keystroke(s)                       Action
=================================  =======================
:kbd:`Control-h`                   Open the help menu
:kbd:`Control-c`                   Abort the current command
:kbd:`Control-q`                   Force-quit VisiData entirely
:kbd:`q`                           Quit the current VisiData "sheet"
:kbd:`gq`                          Quit *all* VisiData sheets and exit gracefully
:kbd:`Shift-U`                     Undo
:kbd:`Shift-R`                     Redo
=================================  =======================

.. note::

   Don't worry about memorizing VisiData's keystrokes. Very quickly, they'll begin to feel intuitive. In the meantime, `this one-page cheat sheet <https://jsvine.github.io/visidata-cheat-sheet/en/>`_ might help.
